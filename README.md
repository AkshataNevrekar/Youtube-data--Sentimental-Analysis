Analysis of the sentiments of comments on the second highest visited site:Youtube!

Sentiment analysis is a machine learning technique that can analyze comments about your brand and your competition for opinion polarity (positive, negative, neutral, and beyond). YouTube users continue to grow by the day, and YouTube comments can provide a wealth of information and actionable insights for any brand. All those unguarded opinions and open customer feedback are free for the taking when you have the right tools in place.

The online users express their opinions or sentiments on the videos that they watch on such sites. TextBlob finds all the words and phrases that it can assign a polarity and subjectivity to, and averages all of them together. Output: Each comment is assigned one polarity, where polarity means how positive or negative a word or a sentence is and range between -1 to +1. -1 is very negative, +1 is very positive.
